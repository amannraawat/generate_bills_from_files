<h1 align="center" id="title">Generate Bills from Excel Files</h1>

<p id="description">The project involves extracting data from Excel files using pandas then utilizing the FPDF library to dynamically generate PDF documents. Through pandas the data is processed to extract item details and corresponding prices. The FPDF library is employed to construct the PDFs allowing for the insertion of extracted data. Subsequently the total price of the bill is calculated by summing up the prices of individual items. This total is then appended to the PDF document providing a comprehensive overview of the bill. Finally the completed PDF is saved ready for distribution or archival purposes ensuring seamless billing processes.</p>
